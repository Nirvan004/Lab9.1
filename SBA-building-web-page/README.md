This is my webpage for my fake company. 
What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
1. some accessibility challenges I faced was not being able to get everything to transfer to a differently sized screen and I hope I ended up fixing this problem.
2. I tried to add as many ARIA headers as I could to help people that needed it to be more easily accessible.
3. The most helpful tools were the html and css websites we were given in class for review along with the color picker we were given in the project also being able to view my website in a browser was helpful
